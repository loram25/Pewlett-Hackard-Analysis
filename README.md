Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis. An HR analyst from Pewlett Hackard (PH), Bobby, needed my help to solve some complicated retirement issues by analyzing their employment data.
I used Quick Database Diagrams to map the schema and the relationships between the tables, including the primary and foreign keys. I wrote Postgres SQL Pgadmin commands to extract data from the 6 database provided and create new database.
Recommendation for further analysis on the data set: These are my suggested analysis on the employment database to better understand the problem of retirement at PH:
Promote high performance employees from the previous title and train them to fill in for employees retiring at a higher title. This will help maintain a growth culture at PH which will drive up employee satisfaction and motivation.# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
